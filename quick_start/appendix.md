## <a name="transition"></a>Transition Node

Transition will be used at staircases, elevators, and double doors at entrance where the blind users can easily follow the building structure without localization support.
You should describe about transition so that the user can follow some object to get the next node.

You need to set `maxDist`, `minDist` values for edge information and `target knn` dist and `pos`.


### <a name="knnDist"></a>knnDist

You need to input maximum and minimum knn distance to all of the edges.

You can get those values as minDist/maxDist in accuracy evaluation result file.
[Accuracy Evaluation](beacon.md#acc_eval)
Please input the values of the edge on map editor.


## <a name="beacon"></a>Beacon Type

There are some types of beacons; Battery, USB powered, water proof, embedded in LED light, and so on.

Type | Pros | Cons
---|---|---
Battery|most popular type, inexpensive|need to replace battery
USB powered|maintenance free|need power tap, expensive
Water proof|can be deployed outside|usually power is battery, expensive
LED light|maintenance free|need socket, expensive

##BLE Beacon Protocol

As of October 2015, there are three BLE beacon protocol. Currently NavCog supports iBeacon.

* [iBeacon (Apple)](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/)
* [EddyStone (Google)](https://developers.google.com/beacons/?hl=en)
* [AltBeacon (Radius Network)](http://altbeacon.org)
